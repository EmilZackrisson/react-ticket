### Why?
I started this project because I wanted a ticket solution that was easy to use and I couldn't find any. So I started learning React, Node.js, MySQL and API's so I could build this project. Many things aren't elegant but im new to this so I try to make it work. If you think you can improve, give it a try and make a pull request, or if you find a bug, create an issue.

### How to set up
#### Server
Start by downloading the repo.
Change the name of the `.env.example` file in the server directory to just `.env`
Start the server by running `nodemon` in the server directory.

#### Client
Open the `settings.json` file in client/src and change the `SERVER_URL` to your servers url. The server runs on port 3001.
Start the client by running `npm start` in the client directory.

### TODO
User List - /settings
Add buttons for removing user.
